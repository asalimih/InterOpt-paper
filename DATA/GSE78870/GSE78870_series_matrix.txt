!Series_summary	"The main goal of the study is to define miR expression levels related to clinical and biological parameters. Now in particular, miR expression levels of fresh frozen (estrogen receptor-positive) primary tumors were related to PIK3CA genotype and with progression-free survival in breast cancer patients with metastatic breast cancer that received first-line aromatase inhibitor therapy."
!Series_overall_design	"Primary breast cancer specimens (N=106) were analyzed for the expression of 768 miRs. The miRs were normalized against the median level of 314 reference assays."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by RT-PCR"

Next, ΔCt normalization was performed using a reference Ct. To establish the reproducibility of the 768 miRNA-assays and to define a reference, a pool of total RNAs from a set of 55 tumor specimens (45-series) was run in triplicate. In total, 314 assays were selected as reference since these assays were negative for no template controls, had results in all three runs with a coefficient of variation less than 2.5% between them, and had for each run correct amplification curves (ΔCt=0.75-1.50 between 0.1/0.2 or 0.05/0.1 threshold). Next, for each individual cancer specimen the median Ct was calculated for these 314 microRNA reference assays. Subsequently, the ΔCt-value was calculated by subtraction of this reference median Ct-value from the Ct-value measured for each target miRNA.

In total, 314 assays were selected as reference since these assays were negative for no template controls, had results in all three runs with a coefficient of variation less than 2.5% between them, and had for each run correct amplification curves (ΔCt=0.75-1.50 between 0.1/0.2 or 0.05/0.1 threshold). Next, for each individual cancer specimen the median Ct was calculated for these 314 microRNA reference assays. Subsequently, the ΔCt-value was calculated by subtraction of this reference median Ct-value from the Ct-value measured for each target miRNA.

In total, 314 assays were selected as reference since these assays were negative for no template controls, had results in all three runs with a coefficient of variation less than 2.5% between them, and had for each run correct amplification curves (ΔCt=0.75-1.50 between 0.1/0.2 or 0.05/0.1 threshold). Next, for each individual cancer specimen the median Ct was calculated for these 314 microRNA reference assays. Subsequently, the ΔCt-value was calculated by subtraction of this reference median Ct-value from the Ct-value measured for each target miRNA.

In total, 314 assays were selected as reference since these assays were negative for no template controls, had results in all three runs with a coefficient of variation less than 2.5% between them, and had for each run correct amplification curves (ΔCt=0.75-1.50 between 0.1/0.2 or 0.05/0.1 threshold). Next, for each individual cancer specimen the median Ct was calculated for these 314 microRNA reference assays. Subsequently, the ΔCt-value was calculated by subtraction of this reference median Ct-value from the Ct-value measured for each target miRNA.

In total, 314 assays were selected as reference since these assays were negative for no template controls, had results in all three runs with a coefficient of variation less than 2.5% between them, and had for each run correct amplification curves (ΔCt=0.75-1.50 between 0.1/0.2 or 0.05/0.1 threshold). Next, for each individual cancer specimen the median Ct was calculated for these 314 microRNA reference assays. Subsequently, the ΔCt-value was calculated by subtraction of this reference median Ct-value from the Ct-value measured for each target miRNA.
