!Series_summary	"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundant in the circulation and play a central role in diverse biological processes; they may be useful for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We conducted a two-phase, case-control study (20 pairs for the discovery set and 49 pairs for the validation set) to test the hypothesis that genome-wide dysregulation of circulating miRNAs differentiate HCC cases from controls. Taqman low density arrays were used to examine genome-wide miRNA expression for the discovery set, and quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate candidate miRNAs for both discovery and validation sets. Sixty-six miRNAs were found to be significantly over-expressed in plasma of HCC cases compared to controls after adjusting for false discovery rate (p<0.05). A volcano plot indicated that 7 miRNAs had greater than 2-fold case-control differences with p<0.01. Four significant miRNAs (miR-150, miR-30c, miR-483-5p and miR-520b) detectable in all samples with varied expression levels were further validated in a validation set. MiR-483-5p was statistically significantly over-expressed in HCC cases compared with controls (3.20 vs. 0.82, p<0.0001). HCC risk factors and clinic-pathological characteristics did not influence miR-483-5p expression. The combination of plasma miR-483-5p level and HCV status can significantly differentiate HCC cases from controls with an AUC of 0.908 (p<0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 75.5% and 89.8%. These preliminary results suggest the importance of dysregulated circulating miR-483-5p as a potential HCC biomarker. Confirmation of aberrant expression of miR-483-5p in a large prospective HCC study will provide support for its application to HCC detection."
!Series_overall_design	"A hospital-based HCC case-control study including 20 HCC patients and 20 controls is conducted in Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), which is approved by the Institutional Review Board. Cases were newly diagnosed HCC patients who were treated in the Hepatobiliary Oncology Clinics, CUMC, and examined pathologically. Controls were recruited from volunteers through the Research Recruitment and Minority Outreach (RRMO) core of Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC). Flyers were placed at strategic locations around CUMC where hospital visitors and employees frequent or were handed out at inreach events at the hospital or at outreach events in the community. Interested participants were directed to contact the trained recruitment staff from the RRMO and given further information about participation. Interested participants were excluded from the control group if diagnosed for any kind of cancer or liver disease. Eligible controls were asked to fill out the same demographic and epidemiological questionnaire as HCC cases. In the current study, controls were matched with HCC cases on age (±5 yrs), gender (male/female) and ethnicities (Caucasian/Hispanic/African-American/Asian)."

!Sample_hyb_protocol	"RT-PCR protocol: TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), including array A and B, were used to measure genome-wide miRNAs expression profiles. A three-step process was performed involving a reverse transcription (RT) reaction followed by preamplification reactions and a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The RT reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions including 1mM dNTPs (including TTP), 50U MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase, 3.8U RNase inhibitor, and 1×Reverse Transcription buffer. Input RNA of 10-100ng was used for each RT reaction. TaqMan stem-loop primers for 746 unique human miRNAs, 2 endogenous controls (MammU6 and U6 snRNA) and 1 negative control (ath-miR-159a) were used in the RT reaction. Conditions for the RT reaction were as follows: 16°C for 30 min, 42°C for 30 min, 85°C for 5 min, then hold at 4°C. The preamplification reaction can preamplify specific cDNA targets to increase the quantity of desired miRNA expression. Within a total volume of 25μl preamplification reaction, it included 2.5μl RT product, 12.5μl TaqMan® OreAmp Master Mix (2x), 2.5μl MagaplexTM PreAmp Primers (10x) and 7.5μl nuclease-free water. Conditions for preamplification included 95°C for 3 min, 55°C for 2 min, 72°C for 2 min, followed by 12 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 4 min, then hold at 99°C for 10 min. The preamplification products were then diluted (10x) by 0.1xTE (pH 8.0) prior to adding TaqMan 2× Universal PCR Master Mix (No AmpErase UNG). The entire mixture was added to individual ports of the TaqMan Human MicroRNA Array v3. The array were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 1 min, and then run on 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system for 95°C, 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated using the SDS2.2.2. Normalized expression was reported as 2−ΔΔCt, where Ct was the threshold cycle to detect fluorescence.

The array were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 1 min, and then run on 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system for 95°C, 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1 min. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated using the SDS2.2.2. Normalized expression was reported as 2−ΔΔCt, where Ct was the threshold cycle to detect fluorescence. Ct value greater than 40 was considered as below the detection threshold of the array."	"RT-PCR protocol: TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), including array A and B, were used to measure genome-wide miRNAs expression profiles. A three-step process was performed involving a reverse transcription (RT) reaction followed by preamplification reactions and a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The RT reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions including 1mM dNTPs (including TTP), 50U MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase, 3.8U RNase inhibitor, and 1×Reverse Transcription buffer. Input RNA of 10-100ng was used for each RT reaction. TaqMan stem-loop primers for 746 unique human miRNAs, 2 endogenous controls (MammU6 and U6 snRNA) and 1 negative control (ath-miR-159a) were used in the RT reaction. Conditions for the RT reaction were as follows: 16°C for 30 min, 42°C for 30 min, 85°C for 5 min, then hold at 4°C. The preamplification reaction can preamplify specific cDNA targets to increase the quantity of desired miRNA expression. Within a total volume of 25μl preamplification reaction, it included 2.5μl RT product, 12.5μl TaqMan® OreAmp Master Mix (2x), 2.5μl MagaplexTM PreAmp Primers (10x) and 7.5μl nuclease-free water. Conditions for preamplification included 95°C for 3 min, 55°C for 2 min, 72°C for 2 min, followed by 12 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 4 min, then hold at 99°C for 10 min. The preamplification products were then diluted (10x) by 0.1xTE (pH 8.0) prior to adding TaqMan 2× Universal PCR Master Mix (No AmpErase UNG).
